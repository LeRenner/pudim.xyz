				Pudim Industries started as a family company. Since the beginning we strived to be a business focused on speed, reliability and, above all, trustworthyness. Throughout the years, we developed rapidly, becoming the one, only, and biggest corporation in existence in earth. Even so, we surely try our best to offer only the best quality services, and the lowest prices on the market.

<!--
The company was founded in 1969, after our great founder had the amazing idea of
creating a company based on the delivery of toilet paper. The idea resonated well,
and after a while, we were reference in the fast and efficient delivery of that so
important commodity. In the summer of 1976 we realized something very important.
The infrastructure we developed was not only capable of delivering, but
nearly elerything that could be packed in a cardboard box.
